# React Testing

## Prerequisites
- Before initiating the test please ensure the Playwright MCP tool is enabled
- Ensure the React development server is running (typically on localhost:3000 or localhost:5173)

## Environment Setup
- Check if .env file exists and contains necessary test credentials
- If .env is missing, ask the user to provide one before proceeding

## Login
- If faced with a login screen, grep the .env, and look for USER_EMAIL and USER_PASSWORD
- Never try to edit .env files or try random credentials, please stop your tasks and ask me to address the login issue

## API Testing
- If API endpoints fail, check the backend service status first
- Don't create random data, ask the user to verify endpoints or check for API documentation
- Look for existing API test files or Postman collections in the project

## Test Data
- Use existing test data when available in the project
- If creating test data is necessary, use realistic but non-sensitive information
- Clean up any test data created during testing unless asked to preserve it

## Error Handling
- If tests fail due to network issues, verify the backend/API is running
- If component rendering fails, check for missing dependencies or build errors

## Verification
- If screenshots from Playwright are needed to verify, please don't commit these to the repository
- Delete screenshot files after verification unless specifically asked to keep them
- If API endpoints fail, don't create random data, ask the user to verify or look for instructions within other rules
