# React Best Practices

## Component Structure
- Use functional components over class components
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use composition over inheritance
- Implement proper prop types with TypeScript
- Split large components into smaller, focused ones

## API Constants 
- Put all API routes under src/constants/apiRoutes.ts
- Define variable routes like: (clientId: number) -> '/clients/${clientId}'

## State Management
- Use useState for local component state
- Implement useReducer for complex state logic
- Use Context API for shared state
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
- Avoid prop drilling through proper state management
- Use state management libraries only when necessary

## Performance
- Implement proper memoization (useMemo, useCallback)
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Implement proper lazy loading
- Use proper key props in lists
- Profile and optimize render performance
